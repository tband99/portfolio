# Thomas Anderson - Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site built with a Modern Dark theme.

## Files
- `index.html` - Main portfolio site

- Project images (starter images included)

## How to Publish with GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository (name it `portfolio` or anything you like).
2. Upload all files from this folder (index.html, resume.pdf, and project images).
3. Commit changes to the `main` branch.
4. Go to **Settings > Pages** in your repository.
5. Under **Source**, choose `Deploy from a branch`.
6. Select `main` branch and `/root` folder, then save.
7. Your portfolio will be live at:  
   `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name/`
